## Getting and cleaning data - Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data for this course project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Goals of this project:
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

  (1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  (2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  
  (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  
  (5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Files contained in this repo:

  (1) Readme.md : You are reading this file now :)
  
  (2) Codebook.md : Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.
  
  (3) run_analysis.R : This is R script file which perform analysis over the input data files.
  
  (4) Tidy_Data.zip : This is zipped csv file of the Tidy data set submitted for peer review per requirements 1 thru' 4 listed above in goal section.
  
  (5) Mean_Data.zip : This is zipped csv file of the Mean data set submitted for peer review per requirement 5 above listed above in goal section.
